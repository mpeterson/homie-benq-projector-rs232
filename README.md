BenQ Projector MQTT <-> RS232 controller based on the [Homie MQTT convention](https://github.com/marvinroger/homie).

This project is a [Homie for ESP8266 v2.0.0](https://github.com/marvinroger/homie-esp8266/releases/tag/v2.0.0) sketch implementing [Homie 2.0.1](https://github.com/marvinroger/homie/releases/tag/v2.0.1).

The goal of the project is to support a big array of commands and thus not need to rely on the IR remote control but it will grow organically as I find time to work on it.

The project follows [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/). It's currently on development (ergo the v0.x.y) towards the first version and is thus unstable in nature. Once it reaches a maturity level that I feel comfortable, I will bump the version to v1.0.0 and continue from there.
